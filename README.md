Overview
========

Hurricane is a [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) mod that enables world movement restriction in a less obtrusive way than
simply enforcing an invisible wall: players who exceed the boundary are repeatedly set on fire or poisoned, as
appropriate for the biome they're in, until they reenter the permitted area.

Features

Current
-------

* World boundary can be set as a circular radius from the world spawn point.
